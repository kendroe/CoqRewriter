An example of Coq plugin that defines a reification tactic. 

The files should be self-documented, even though we may manage to build a pdf that summarizes every interesting point. The project needs coq8.5(pl2).

INSTRUCTIONS
============

1. Build the makefile with:

  coq_makefile -f arguments.txt -o Makefile

2. run "make"

FILES DESCRIPTION
=================

arguments.txt : the pre-makefile that is fed to coq_makefile (coq_makefile -f arguments.txt -o Makefile)
src/lib_coq.ml{i} : an interface with Coq, where we define some handlers for Coq's API and constructs. 
src/plugin.ml4 : the actual plugin that defines a reification tactic for a very simple subset of terms on nat
src/Theory.v : reification primer
test-suite/example.v : an example of usage of the tactic we defined in src/plugin.ml4.
